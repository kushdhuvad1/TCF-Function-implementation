# Quantum_Algo_Project
The project focuses on the implementation of quantum cryptographic quantum protocol alogoritm. This quantum project utilizes trapdoor claw-free functions based on Rabin's function and the Diffie_Hellman problem. We implemented only Rabin's fucntion. The implementation consists of three rounds of interaction between a quantum prover and a classical verifier. 

### The first round 
A multi-qubit superposition is generated over two bitstrings, which are cryptographically challenging to compute classically. 
### The second round 
This superposition is mapped onto the state of an ancilla qubit, retaining sufficient information to ensure that the resulting single qubit remains difficult to compute classically.
### The final round 
A CHSH-type Bell inequality measurement is performed, with the result being cryptographically protected. 

# OPTIMIZATION AND RESULTS 
## Quantum Circuit Simulation
The quantum circuits were simulated using the Classiq Python SDK, which enabled a comparison of circuit depth and width across several hardware simulators.

## Optimization and Hardware Simulation
The circuits were optimized for depth, with a constraint of using more than 50 qubits for simulation on the Azure Quantum simulator. The synthesized circuit requires a depth of 255 levels on the Azure Quantum IonQ hardware simulator.
